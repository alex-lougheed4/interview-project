# Helios Takehome Task

# Instructions 
1. Clone code
2. Run `npm install` inside the "helios" directory
3. Run `npm run dev` to run a local version of the web app
4. Run `npm test` to run the unit tests.

# Trade-Offs 
Wasn't able to get an App.test.tsx working due to the use of an SVG (Jest incompatability) in the given timeframe
I would usually use a library such as TanStack query or Axios to facilitate api requests but as per the design spec i've used a util function.
